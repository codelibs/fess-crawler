# Introduction

This is a sample Markdown document for testing the MarkdownExtractor.

## Features

The extractor should handle:

- YAML front matter extraction
- Heading structure
- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- Lists and other formatting

### Code Examples

Here is some inline `code` and a code block:

```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
